# XGBoost-Regressor-Code-from-Scratch
**XGBoost-**
XGBoost was the first of The Big Three gradient boosting frameworks, released in 2014. The other two are LightGBM by Microsoft and launched in 2016, and CatBoost by Yandex, launched in 2017. Each of these frameworks are magnificent tools to tackling tabular data problems, using either regression or classification.

This repository is created to understand the logic behind XGBoost Regressor algorithm.
The highlight of the code created for the Regressor is that, the algorithm directly can be applied to-
1. Numeric and
2. String type fields.

We do not need to perform any type of encoding for the catrgorical variables.

Though this may not be the exact code used for XGBoostRegressor, but this can give you a basic understanding of how the algorithm is working internally.
